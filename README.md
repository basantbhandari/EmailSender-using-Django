# EmailSender-using-Django
 With Django, we create an email Automator that sends emails to a specific group of recipients automatically. You’d have the option of modifying the message of the email and selecting the recipients of the same. It’s a simple, fun, and exciting project. For this we used a simple Django form for taking user input than for sending the email we use SMTP protocol and it worked. plenty of room for improvement
